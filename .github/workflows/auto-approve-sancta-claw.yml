# Security model — autonomous bot operation for sancta-claw scope:
#
# This workflow allows kuzea-bot PRs scoped to sancta-claw and openclaw modules
# to be approved and merged WITHOUT human review. This is by design.
#
# What IS enforced (active controls):
#   1. Actor gating: only kuzea-bot PRs are considered.
#   2. Fork rejection: head.repo.full_name must match this repository.
#   3. Path scoping: only hosts/sancta-claw/** and modules/services/openclaw*.nix.
#   4. Nix validation: nix flake check + nix eval must pass (hard gate).
#   5. Required CI checks: check.yml "Build sancta-claw" must pass before merge
#      (branch protection). This catches derivation build failures.
#   6. All external actions pinned to immutable commit SHAs.
#   7. Concurrency: parallel runs are cancelled, preventing duplicate approvals.
#
# What is NOT enforced (accepted risks — confirmed by @alexandru-savinov):
#   - ACCEPTED RISK: No human review for sancta-claw-scoped changes.
#     CODEOWNERS assigns @alexandru-savinov for all files (*), but "Require
#     review from Code Owners" is NOT enabled in branch protection. This is
#     intentional: the goal is autonomous bot operation within the scoped
#     blast radius.
#   - ACCEPTED RISK: No runtime correctness validation. Nix eval validates
#     config structure but cannot detect malicious-but-valid configs (e.g.
#     rogue ExecStartPre, insecure environment variables, secret
#     exfiltration via ExecStartPost). A compromised kuzea-bot could craft
#     syntactically valid but malicious config that passes all automated
#     gates. This is an inherent limitation of static eval and is accepted
#     given the limited blast radius (sancta-claw only).
#
# ACCEPTED RISK — Privileged shared module scope (openclaw.nix, openclaw-container.nix):
#   These modules define a system user (openclaw, uid=995), a systemd service
#   with ExecStart/ReadWritePaths, and Tailscale Serve configuration. They are
#   shared NixOS modules (currently imported by sancta-claw and sancta-choir),
#   not host-specific config. Auto-approving changes to shared modules extends
#   blast radius beyond a single host. This risk is accepted because:
#   - sancta-choir does not currently use openclaw-container.nix (commented out).
#   - Changes still require check.yml full builds to pass before merge.
#   - Only sancta-claw actively deploys via autoUpgrade; sancta-choir
#     deploys manually.
#   - Shared infra (flake.nix, common.nix, secrets/) and other hosts
#     (nixframe, rpi5, sancta-choir) require manual review (path scoping).
#   - @alexandru-savinov is notified on every auto-approved PR.
#
# ACCEPTED RISK — Zero-human-review deployment pipeline:
#   kuzea-bot opens PR → this workflow auto-approves → check.yml must pass →
#   PR merges → system.autoUpgrade deploys to sancta-claw within 24h (04:30).
#   No human reviews shell commands at any stage. The security model trusts
#   that kuzea-bot will not be compromised or manipulated into generating
#   malicious NixOS config. This is accepted given the limited blast radius
#   (sancta-claw only) and active @alexandru-savinov notification on each PR.
#
# Scope maintenance:
# - openclaw.nix/openclaw-container.nix are currently only used by sancta-claw
#   and sancta-choir. If other hosts import them, revisit this scope.
# TODO: When sancta-choir re-enables openclaw-container.nix, add its eval here.
