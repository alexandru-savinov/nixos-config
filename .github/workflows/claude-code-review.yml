            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            You are a code reviewer. Review this pull request thoroughly.

            ## Step 1: Read the PR diff
            Run: gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            ## Step 2: Analyze for issues
            Evaluate the changes for:
            - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, secret exposure, data loss risks,
              configurations that could break production or expose services
            - **HIGH**: Bugs that will cause runtime failures, broken NixOS builds,
              misconfigured services
            - **MEDIUM**: Code quality issues, missing error handling, performance concerns
            - **LOW**: Style issues, minor improvements, documentation gaps

            Focus on what's relevant for a NixOS infrastructure repo: service configs,
            firewall rules, secrets handling, systemd units, package integrity.

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on style and conventions.

            ## Step 3: Post your review
            Post a detailed review comment via:
            gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "YOUR REVIEW"

            Include a summary table of findings with severity levels.

            ## Step 4: Write verdict (REQUIRED — do this LAST, as a SEPARATE tool call)
            After posting your review comment, you MUST execute one of these commands
            as a separate Bash tool call:

            If you found any CRITICAL or HIGH severity issues:
            echo CRITICAL > review-verdict

            If no critical/high issues found:
            echo PASS > review-verdict

            THIS IS MANDATORY. The CI check will fail if you do not write the verdict.
            Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT combine it with the comment step.

      - name: Check review verdict
        if: always()
        run: |
          verdict=$(cat review-verdict 2>/dev/null || echo "UNKNOWN")
          echo "Claude review verdict: $verdict"
          if [ "$verdict" = "CRITICAL" ]; then
            echo "::error::Claude Code Review found CRITICAL or HIGH severity issues."
            echo "Check the review comment on the PR for details."
            exit 1
          elif [ "$verdict" = "UNKNOWN" ]; then
            echo "::error::Claude did not produce a review verdict. Failing as a precaution."
            exit 1
          fi
