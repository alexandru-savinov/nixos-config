# CODEOWNERS — require review for sensitive paths

# Default: Alexandru reviews everything

# Kuzea (AI agent) primarily works on sancta-claw config and openclaw
# service module. These still require Alexandru's review, but CODEOWNERS
# makes it explicit and ensures no PR slips through unreviewed.
#
# Paths that affect other machines (nixframe, rpi5, sancta-choir) or
# core infrastructure (flake.nix, secrets, common.nix) are protected
# by the wildcard rule above.
