# Soul-mirror VAULT (puller half) — the rpi5 end of the choir↔rpi5 soul-mirror.
#
# REWORKED 2026-07-22 (push→pull, tailnet ACL correction): the tailnet ACL is
# choir=source-only / rpi5=home-reaches-out — "home/rpi5 reaches OUT to
# cloud/choir, cloud never reaches IN". A choir→rpi5 push (the OLD design)
# violated that invariant (it needed choir→rpi5, which the ACL forbids). This
# rework flips it: rpi5 now PULLS the already-encrypted archives FROM choir
# over rpi5→choir:22, which the ACL already allows. choir makes ZERO outbound
# connections of its own — see modules/services/sancta-soul-mirror.nix, whose
# only network-facing surface now is a READ-ONLY rrsync endpoint that THIS
# host connects TO, never the reverse.
#
# This host rsyncs choir's local vault (cfg.remoteDir on choir, i.e. the
# producer's `localDir`) into ITS OWN vault (cfg.vaultDir) via a DEDICATED
# pull ssh key (agenix: secrets/soul-mirror-pull-ssh-key.age, private half
# decrypted only on rpi5). The matching PUBLIC key is authorized on choir
# behind a restricted READ-ONLY rrsync forced command (see pullPubKey in
# sancta-soul-mirror.nix) — that key can read ciphertext out of one directory
# and nothing else: no write, no shell, no other path.
#
# Archives are persisted DIRECTLY as the .age files pulled from choir — NO
# restic, NO re-encryption. The payload is already age-ciphertext; wrapping it
# in another encrypted-backup layer would be pure overhead and would also
# complicate restore (a restore must be able to `age -d` the file straight out
# of this vault, unwrapped). This vault dir is a separate namespace from
# /root/dr (the rpi5→sancta-claw self-backup vault) so the two never collide.
#
# ZERO-KNOWLEDGE (shape 2, UNCHANGED by this rework): this host holds ONLY
# ciphertext and NO recovery key. A root compromise of the home-facing rpi5
# still cannot open the soul. Restore is done off-host with the recovery key
# (Bitwarden / a keyed host) — never here.
#
# PROVISIONING (his-hand, one-time):
#   a. Generate the pull key ON (or for) rpi5:
#        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "rpi5 -> sancta-choir soul-mirror pull" -f /tmp/smp
#   b. Put the PRIVATE half into agenix (only rpi5 decrypts it):
#        agenix -e secrets/soul-mirror-pull-ssh-key.age   # paste /tmp/smp (private)
#   c. Put the PUBLIC half (/tmp/smp.pub) into
#      services.sancta-soul-mirror.pullPubKey on sancta-choir.
#   d. Rebuild BOTH hosts (either order — both self-suppress/stay-inert until
#      their respective half of the key pair is real).
#   e. The recovery age key is UNCHANGED and stays off-rpi5 — this rework only
#      changes which host dials out, not restore capability.
#
# RETIRED: the OLD choir→rpi5 PUSH key (agenix sancta-soul-mirror-push-ssh-key,
# authorized here as `backupPushPubKey` under root with a put/sha256/list/
# prune forced command) is gone. This host no longer authorizes ANY inbound
# key from choir — choir cannot reach in, full stop.
